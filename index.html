In the United States there have been over 12,000,000 coronavirus cases and over 240,000 deaths. Within the US, each state chooses how to handle the spread and effects of the coronavirus. This includes possible statewide mask mandates and lockdowns. The policies are created by the local lawmakers that were elected into office in 2016. This visulization will help people discover possible connections between policies and COVID-19 cases.
